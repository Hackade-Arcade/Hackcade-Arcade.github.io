                    <h2>Asteroids</h2>
                    <p>Asteroids is a 2-dimensional game: what’s on the screen is flat rather than being a view of a 3-D world (so it’s like Worms,
                        say, rather than Quake).
                        The game starts with the player’s space ship on the screen, along with some asteroids. The ship starts off not moving, but
                        the asteroids start off moving at a random speed in a random direction.
                        In the game, the player guides the ship around the screen, shooting bullets at asteroids. When an asteroid is hit, it splits up
                        into smaller asteroids which fly off. When a small asteroid is hit, it disappears from the screen. If an asteroid or bullet hits
                        the player’s ship, the player loses the game. If the player manages to shoot all the asteroids on the screen, the player wins
                        the game.
                        The player controls the space ship by rotating it left and right and using the rocket thrusters on the back of the space ship to
                        push it in the direction it’s pointing in. When the player fires, the bullets come out of the front of the space ship and travel
                        in the direction the ship is pointing in.</p>

                    <h2>Pacman</h2>
                    <p>Pac-Man is an action maze chase video game; the player controls the eponymous character through an enclosed maze. The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts — Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange) — that pursue him. When Pac-Man eats all of the dots, the player advances to the next level. If Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost. Each of the four ghosts have their own unique, distinct artificial intelligence (A.I.), or "personalities"; Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man, Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him, and Clyde will switch between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him.

                        Placed at the four corners of the maze are large flashing "energizers", or "power pellets". Eating these will cause the ghosts to turn blue with a dizzied expression and reverse direction. Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when eaten, their eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze, where the ghosts "regenerate" and resume their normal activity. Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value. After a certain amount of time, blue-colored ghosts will flash white before turning back into their normal, lethal form. Eating a certain number of dots in a level will cause a bonus item - usually in the form of a fruit – to appear underneath the center box, which can be eaten for bonus points.

                    <h2>Tetris</h2>
                    <p>Tetris has very simple rules: you can only move the pieces in specific ways; your game is over if your pieces reach the top of the screen; and you can only remove pieces from the screen by filling all the blank space in a line.</p>
